# First Milestone Project (still currently under Development)

BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT:

This is my first Milestone Project for Full-Stack Diploma in Software Development. It's a website on The Monkee's (the 1960's group formed over 50 years ago). The website consists of 3 main pages and is primarily composed of Semantic HTML5 and CSS3, using Grids in Bootstrap framework and components. I used Bootstrap V. 3.3.7, implementing also min.js and jquery plugin, as well as utilising font awesome for icons. The website is about a Band who are well known and been around a long time. 

The Monkees band wish to gain a social media presents, and so links for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have been added, and more may also be added. The Band (The Monkees) wish to showcase their back catalogue of songs, as well as their new releases and also wish to publicise their availability to perform at Weddings and Christmas parties.

WIREFRAMES:

Initially I did some mock-ups (Wireframes), using UX tool (Balsamiq) to design a layout and did some mock-ups, however later these mock-ups were modified and I changed around some things and will later upload the most current mock-up's, which I don't have presently available.

UX DESIGN AND USER STORIES:

I tried to visualise and understand the User Experience, and what a typical user of the website would require and why they would visit my website in particular. The type of user would be anyone, in any age group, you and old. 

In particular I feel the site would attract those who were around at the time of the Monkee's and remember their songs and and their movies and would hope to add links also to their TV series. I would like it to be an enjoyable website for users and maybe bring back reminences of past years. I also would like to spread the world to younger audiences of how great a band the Monkee's were and how highly successful they were in the 1960's (more so even than the Beatles). 

I hope to update my website with newer releases and new articles. The site, at present, is still in the development stage still, although the primary design plan has been implemented, I hope to add more to this website before it is finally submitted.

TESTING:

From a testing view-point, I've tested responsiveness on both mobile and desktop, in a variety of screen sizes. Further testing will be undertaken and I hope also to improve on navigation controls for users to easily navigate forward and back through controls either side of the screen, rather than having to return to navbar to click on another link. Further tests will be done throughout to test functionality before submission.

I have tested the MP4 HD video ("Daydream Believer") and it plays on Firefox and Internet Explorer, however there is a problem playing it on Chrome browser, due to codecs issue. I have not yet tested it on Chrome, Safari, Opera.

I have tested the website on a variety of devices using firefox dev tools (responsive mode) - Apple iPad Air2, Apple iPad Mini2, Apple iPad iPhone 6s, Google nexus 4,5,6,7, Laptop (1280 x 720 and 1366 x 768), Nokia Lumia 520, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung Galaxy S5 and S7. Also tested on Desktop. 

GITHUB:

I used version control on an ongoing basis to back-up my code to a remote repository and used version control at regular intervals throughout development.

DEPLOYMENT:
This is the website deployed link, but still have improvements to make on this website before submission.
