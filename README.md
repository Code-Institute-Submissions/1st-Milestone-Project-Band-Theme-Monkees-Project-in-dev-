# First Milestone Project - still currently under Development

## **BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT**

This is my first Milestone Project for Full-Stack Diploma in Software Development. It's a website on The Monkee's (the 1960's group formed over 50 years ago). The website consists of 3 main pages and is primarily composed of Semantic HTML5 and CSS3, using Grids in Bootstrap framework and components. I used Bootstrap V. 3.3.7, implementing also min.js and jquery plugin, as well as utilising font awesome for icons. The website is about a Band who are well known and been around a long time. The Monkees band wish to gain a social media presents, and so links for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have been added, and more may also be added. The Band (The Monkees) wish to showcase their back catalogue of songs, as well as their new releases and also wish to publicise their availability to perform at Weddings and Christmas parties. 

## **WIREFRAMES**

Initially I did some mock-ups (Wireframes), using UX tool (Balsamiq) to design a layout and did some mock-ups, however later these mock-ups were modified and I changed around some things and will later upload the most current mock-up's, which I don't have presently available. 

## **UX DESIGN AND USER STORIES**

I tried to visualise and understand the User Experience, and what a typical user of the website would require and why they would visit my website in particular. The type of user would be anyone, in any age group, you and old. In particular I feel the site would attract those who were around at the time of the Monkee's and remember their songs and and their movies and would hope to add links also to their TV series. I would like it to be an enjoyable website for users and maybe bring back reminences of past years. I also would like to spread the world to younger audiences of how great a band the Monkee's were and how highly successful they were in the 1960's (more so even than the Beatles). 

For direction in UX design, I refer to Code Institute tutorials, and also to https://www.redrocketmg.com/5-planes-ux-design-great-website. I consider the two very important aspects to designing a good website - (1) Abstract (idea, goal, etc) and (2) Concrete (how to get a user to click on a link, etc). The transition from abstract to concrete should remain linear to ensure a smooth transition, with each phase being fluid and overlapping. Garret's 5 Planes of UX design are as follows:-

### Strategy
What’s the end goal of your website? Is it to attract more customers? Is it to sign up visitors for a monthly newsletter? Is it to sell your latest novel? Let’s say for the sake of discussion – you’re selling a great new novel about teenage vampires. Your UX strategy will provide focus and the foundation for the remaining planes of UX design.

### Scope
The list of tasks users should be able to accomplish when visiting your website. What are the hoops users need to jump through to reach your end goal? Can your users search for your novel based on keywords? Can users read excerpts of your novel or view the cover artwork? Can your users save your novel in a shopping cart or see other books they might be interested in?
Structure
This is the plan or flow of interactions users will take to navigate your website. A structure typically contains both a site map and a flow chart. Typically a site map helps visualize how the content of the website will exist but a flow chart that describes interaction helps to make our UX strategy more concrete.
Skeleton
Now that we’ve decided on the goals, scope and flow our website. The first visual element or wireframes help to ensure that the strategy, scope and structure of the website mesh properly while avoiding the details of aesthetics. It places headlines, copy, buttons and a call to action with getting weighted down by color, typography or imagery. This phase ensures a clear definition for everything visitors will see on the site.
Surface
The surface, or the skin – is the interface for which visitors will engage with your business. Consider the decision of using English or Spanish, or the use of slang or industry jargon that might alienate some portions of your audience. Typography, colors, photography and language – all these things create a surface experience for your audience. Elements such as buttons provide a visceral connection when they are familiar to us. If a button looks and responds like something we might find on our keyboard – it becomes real for us and that becomes a great user experience.

## **TESTING**

From a testing view-point, I've tested responsiveness on both mobile and desktop, in a variety of screen sizes. Further testing will be undertaken and I hope also to improve on navigation controls for users to easily navigate forward and back through controls either side of the screen, rather than having to return to navbar to click on another link. Further tests will be done throughout to test functionality before submission. I have tested the MP4 HD video ("Daydream Believer") and it plays on Firefox and Internet Explorer (IE 11.0.9600.17843) and and Chrome browser (67.0.3396.99 (Official Build) (32-bit)). I have not yet tested it on Safari or Opera. I have tested the website on a variety of devices using firefox dev tools (responsive mode) - Apple iPad Air2, Apple iPad Mini2, Apple iPad iPhone 6s, Google nexus 4,5,6,7, Laptop (1280 x 720 and 1366 x 768), Nokia Lumia 520, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung Galaxy S5 and S7\. Also tested on Desktop. 

## **VERSION CONTROL GITHUB**

I used version control on an ongoing basis to back-up my code to a remote repository and used version control at regular intervals throughout development. 

## **DEPLOYMENT**

This is the website deployed link, but still have some improvements to make on this website before submission. The Monkees Website [link to The Monkees Website](https://deirdre18.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project-Band-Theme-Monkees-Project-in-dev-/)
